# Crawling-Kino-Results

This code uses **Regular Expressions or RegEx** in Python, in order to scrape a web page to collect thousands of Kino results. It creates 3 files: numbers.csv, dates.csv and draws.csv. numbers.csv contains the numbers of the draw, dates.csv, as it's name says, contains the date of each draw and draws.csv contains the draw number.
